**Best overview for getting started right now:** [This snippet](https://gist.github.com/johnnyman727/f76616edc71a8646b27b27809ea464c6), published July 5th (2016) is the most helpful introduction at the moment.

### tessel-rust
This repo hosts the Tessel library that provides the hardware API (`gpio.high()`, `spi.transfer()`, etc.) to user applications. It is currently incomplete (see gist above for current status) and could use your help to finish it up. The API should end up being very similar to the [JavaScript API](https://tessel.io/docs/hardwareAPI).
